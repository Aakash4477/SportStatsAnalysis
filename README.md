Project exploring Data Collection, Visualisation and Analysis of Sports Statistics.


## Project Outline

I wanted to explore the world of Sport Statistics and specifically focus on my favourite club, the mighty Leeds United. There is a huge amount of data recorded on all aspects of the sport, from overall match statistics down to the specific body part used to score goals. My initial plan was to collect a large amount of data on the club and sport as a whole, clean it and use it to build a database in MySQL. With the database build, I would write I number of queries to deliver specific and useful insight into how the team is performing and use Tableau to create a dashboard to visualise the data. With a large amount of data recorded, I would atempt to answer a number of statistical questions related to the sport.
