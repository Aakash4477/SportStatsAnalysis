Project exploring Data Collection, Visualisation and Analysis of Sports Statistics.


## Project Outline

I wanted to explore the world of Sport Statistics and specifically focus on my favourite club, the mighty Leeds United. There is a huge amount of data recorded on all aspects of the sport, from overall match statistics down to the specific body part used to score goals. My initial plan was to collect a large amount of data on the club and sport as a whole, clean it and use it to build a database in MySQL. With the database build, I would write I number of queries to deliver specific and useful insight into how the team is performing and use Tableau to create a dashboard to visualise the data. With a large amount of data recorded, I would attempt to answer a number of statistical questions related to the sport.

## The Data

With a large amount of data available, I explored a number of different sources that could be used to collect the it from. There are a number of sports statistics APIs, but many of the better ones require a paid licence key. I found the best sources for data were smaller, independent websites, where data scraping was easy and some even offer CSV files for download without registration.

Using Python, I scraped a number of different pages into Pandas Dataframes and the began to explore the data and begin cleaning it.
